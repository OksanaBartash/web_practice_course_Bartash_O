		<p>&nbsp; I think only nature is perfect in
			everything.
			Every person, no matter how accomplished or capable, has weaknesses.
			I am not a perfectionist, so I have weaknesses:<br>
			Procrastination: Sometimes it is difficult for me to manage my time effectively or maintain focus on tasks.
			But I read a lot of information about how I need to learn and control my focus.<br>
			Also I spoke with a psychologist about it and she gave me advice - now every evening I made a detailed plan for
			the next day.
			It helps me and really I can see what I did and if I can’t do everything I analyze and draw conclusions.<br>
			Lack of self-confidence: Sometimes I lose lack of belief in my abilities especially if something goes wrong.
			I have a family who always supports me.<br>
			Also I try following advice from successful people - working on yourself, fighting with my fears which prevent
			me from taking risks, pursuing my goals.<br>
			Poor stress management: It depends on situations, sometimes I get a lot of stress.
			It is impossible to live life and not experience stress!
			Of course, I try to find a way out and solve the problem, or drink a sedative and try to find a way out and
			solve the problem again.<br>
			What doesn't kill us makes us stronger)))<br>
			I am - Oksana Bartash know and recognize and understand these weaknesses to strive for personal growth and
			improvement.</p>
